// The actor parser needs specific models due to the high amount of inconsistencies in the data source
// Mainly because it appears the third-party's sort method is broken, as we found some actors display every other entry
// which requires us to keep track of at least 5 to 10 actors or so, and see if they were already found before.
// This makes the code quite a bit more inefficient and slower, unfortunately
